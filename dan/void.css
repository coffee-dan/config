Catalog container, catalog and link details
=======================================================================
This formatting system is used as the traditional logic for tables
	in HTML is not suitible for constant updates due to the central 
	unit of organization being rows instead of columns. Therefore the
	catalog and catalog container system focuses on columns such that
	categorizing links is made easy.
@Catalog container - A "table", not a literal HTMl table.
@Catalog - A column within the "table" that has two elements related
	to it, the catalog-title and catalog-list.
@Catalog-title - A label for the category of item being put into the
	catalog.
@Catalog-list - A collection of items that make up the catalog, the
	items inside are links. Merely named for organizational purposes
	but can be used for unique styling.
@Link - A link. This class was created to ensure control over the
	styling of a link inside of the catalog system. It is the 
	fundamental unit of the catalog.
